## Problem

Many readers face challenges in finding books that suit their preferences and moods. Traditional recommendation methods often fall short by relying on:
- Bestseller lists
- Generic reviews

**Challenges with Existing Platforms:**
- **Limited Personalization:** Systems like Goodreads and Amazon rely heavily on user ratings and past purchases, which may not reflect evolving tastes.
- **Lack of Nuanced Interpretation:** Existing systems often miss out on nuanced user inputs, such as themes, moods, or stylistic preferences.

**Example:**
- **Librarian.AI:** Provides personalized recommendations but primarily focuses on genres and ratings. It does not process detailed textual inputs.

**Proposed Solution:**
- **Advanced NLP Integration:** Use NLP techniques to analyze user inputs more deeply, capturing context and sentiment for tailored book recommendations.

## NLP Model Purpose

**Keyword Extraction vs. Text Summarization**

**Keyword Extraction:**
- **Pros:**
  - **Specificity:** Identifies relevant topics, genres, and themes.
  - **Precision:** Directly maps to specific books or categories.
  - **Simplicity:** Easier to implement and understand.
- **Cons:**
  - **Context Loss:** May miss broader context in long or complex inputs.
  - **Limited Insight:** Might not provide comprehensive recommendations.

**Text Summarization:**
- **Pros:**
  - **Context Preservation:** Captures broader context and main ideas.
  - **Enhanced Understanding:** Provides nuanced insights for better recommendations.
- **Cons:**
  - **Complexity:** More complex and computationally intensive.
  - **Over-Simplification:** Potentially misses specific details.

**Choosing the Right Approach:**
- **Short and Focused Inputs:** Use keyword extraction for quick and precise identification.
- **Long and Detailed Inputs:** Use text summarization to capture main ideas and nuances.

**Hybrid Approach:**
- **Initial Analysis:** Apply keyword extraction for key themes.
- **Contextual Understanding:** Use text summarization for broader context.
- **Combined Insights:** Integrate both methods for comprehensive recommendations.
