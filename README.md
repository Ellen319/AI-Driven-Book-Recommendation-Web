# AI-Driven-Book-Recommendation-Web

Overview
The proposed project, which I would name it “BookSense — Books That Know You”, aims to create a web-based application that provides personalized book recommendations to readers. This project falls under the domain of AI-driven recommendation systems within the web development industry. The service will be available online, targeting avid readers looking for tailored book suggestions based on their inputs (words or sentences). The structure of the project includes a user-friendly front-end interface, a secure user authentication system, and an AI-powered recommendation engine.

Problem
Many readers struggle to find books that match their preferences and reading mood. Traditional recommendation methods, such as bestseller lists and generic reviews, often fail to capture individual tastes. 
This project addresses this issue by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and AI to provide personalized book recommendations, enhancing the reading experience and helping users discover books that align with their interests.
In my research, I found that there seems to be few AI-powered book recommendation systems available. Many existing platforms (such as Goodreads and Amazon) rely heavily on user ratings and past purchase history, which do not always reflect the diverse and evolving interests of readers. Additionally, these systems often lack the capability to interpret nuanced user inputs, such as specific themes, moods, or stylistic preferences. For example, Librarian.AI is an AI-powered platform providing personalized book recommendations based on user preferences. It categorizes recommendations into various genres, including thrillers, nonfiction, fiction, fantasy, and biographies, allowing users to discover and rate books. However, Librarian.AI does have a limitation where users cannot input a sentence or detailed textual input to get recommendations. The platform primarily relies on user interactions like choosing genres and rating books rather than processing complex, nuanced user inputs. 
To overcome these limitations, my project will intergrade NLP techniques to analyze user inputs in more depth. By understanding the context and sentiment behind the words and sentences that users provide, my system will generate more relevant and tailored book recommendations. This approach not only enhances the accuracy of recommendations but also enriches the overall reading experience by introducing readers to books they might not have discovered otherwise.
